# Hi 👋 I'm Wilton Miller  

---

## 🧠 About Me  
I'm a third-year **Computer Science Specialist** student at the **University of Toronto**, also completing a **Mathematics Major**.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **theoretical computer science**, and **pure mathematics**, especially how **deep learning** can expand our access to knowledge and enhance the way people learn and work.  

Outside academia, I’m a fan of **Formula 1** and **video games** (Fun fact: I was once ranked the #1 Star Wars Battlefront 2 Player in the world).

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- 🤖 Exploring **Machine Learning** and its theoretical foundations  
- 💡 Studying rigorous mathematical theory in **analysis**, **topology**, and related foundations  
- 🧩 Experimenting with **Swift** to build meaningful iOS applications  
- 🔍 Investigating how **AI** can improve access to education and information
